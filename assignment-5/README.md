# 🏛️ Assignment 5: DAO Smart Contract

## 📌 Brief Description
This assignment implements a basic **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** using a smart contract.  
The DAO allows users to:
- Create proposals  
- Vote on proposals  
- Execute proposals after a deadline  

All actions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring **transparency and decentralization**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- Solidity (0.8.x)  
- Remix IDE  
- MetaMask  
- Sepolia Testnet  

---

## 📜 Smart Contract Features

### ✔ Proposal Creation
- Only the contract owner can create a proposal  
- Each proposal includes:
  - Description  
  - Vote count  
  - Deadline  
  - Execution status  

---

### ✔ Voting Mechanism
- Users can vote on a proposal using its ID  
- Each address can vote **only once per proposal**  
- Votes are counted using a `voteCount` variable  

---

### ✔ Proposal Execution
- A proposal can be executed **after the deadline**  
- Execution marks the proposal as completed  
- Ensures proposal cannot be executed multiple times  

---

## ⚙️ DAO Workflow

1. **Create Proposal**
   - User submits proposal with description and duration  
   - Stored on blockchain  

2. **Vote**
   - Users vote using proposal ID  
   - Votes are counted  

3. **Wait for Deadline**
   - Proposal remains open until deadline  

4. **Execute Proposal**
   - After deadline, proposal is executed  
   - Status changes to `executed = true`

## 🚀 How to Run

### ▶️ Step 1: Open Remix
- Go to https://remix.ethereum.org  

---

### ▶️ Step 2: Compile Contract
- Open `dao.sol`  
- Select Solidity compiler (0.8.x)  
- Click **Compile**

---

### ▶️ Step 3: Deploy Contract
- Go to **Deploy & Run Transactions**  
- Select **Browser Extension (MetaMask)**  
- Connect wallet  
- Select **Sepolia Testnet**  
- Click **Deploy**  
- Confirm transaction in MetaMask

## 🧪 Execution Steps

### 🟢 1. Create Proposal
- Call function: `createProposal`
- Input:
  - Description: `"Buy new equipment"`  
  - Duration: `60` seconds  
- Confirm in MetaMask  

---

### 🔵 2. Vote on Proposal
- Call function: `vote`
- Input:
  - Proposal ID: `0`  
- Confirm transaction  

---

### 🟡 3. Execute Proposal
- Wait until deadline (~60 seconds)  
- Call function: `executeProposal(0)`  
- Confirm transaction  

---

### 🔍 4. View Proposals
- Call function: `getProposals()`  
- Displays:
  - Description  
  - Vote count  
  - Deadline  
  - Execution status  

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Decentralized governance  
- Smart contract-based voting  
- Proposal lifecycle management  
- Blockchain transparency
